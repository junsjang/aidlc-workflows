# Infrastructure Design

## Prerequisites
- Functional Design must be complete for the unit
- NFR Design recommended (provides logical components to map)
- Execution plan must indicate Infrastructure Design stage should execute

## Overview
Map logical software components to actual infrastructure choices for deployment environments.

## Steps to Execute

### Step 1: Analyze Design Artifacts
- Read functional design from `aidlc-docs/construction/{unit-name}/functional-design/`
- Read NFR design from `aidlc-docs/construction/{unit-name}/nfr-design/` (if exists)
- Identify logical components needing infrastructure

### Step 2: Create Infrastructure Design Plan
- Generate plan with checkboxes [] for infrastructure design
- Focus on mapping to actual services (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premise)
- Each step should have a checkbox []

### Step 3: Generate Context-Appropriate Questions
**DIRECTIVE**: Thoroughly analyze the functional and NFR design to identify ALL areas where clarification would improve infrastructure decisions. Be proactive in asking questions to ensure comprehensive infrastructure coverage.

**CRITICAL**: Default to asking questions when there is ANY ambiguity or missing detail that could affect infrastructure design quality. It's better to ask too many questions than to make incorrect assumptions.

- EMBED questions using [Answer]: tag format
- Focus on ANY ambiguities, missing information, or areas needing clarification
- Generate questions wherever user input would improve infrastructure decisions
- **When in doubt, ask the question** - overconfidence leads to poor designs

**Question categories to consider** (evaluate ALL categories):
- **Deployment Environment** - Ask about cloud provider, region selection, environment setup, and deployment targets
- **Compute Infrastructure** - Ask about compute service choices, instance types, and scaling configurations
- **Storage Infrastructure** - Ask about database selection, storage types, backup strategies, and data lifecycle
- **Messaging Infrastructure** - Ask about messaging and queuing services, event-driven patterns, and throughput needs
- **Networking Infrastructure** - Ask about load balancing, API gateway approach, DNS, and network segmentation
- **Monitoring Infrastructure** - Ask about observability tooling, logging, metrics, alerting, and dashboards
- **Shared Infrastructure** - Ask about infrastructure sharing strategy, resource pooling, and multi-tenancy approach

### Step 4: Store Plan
- Save as `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/{unit-name}-infrastructure-design-plan.md`
- Include all [Answer]: tags for user input

### Step 5: Collect and Analyze Answers
- Wait for user to complete all [Answer]: tags
- **MANDATORY**: Carefully review ALL responses for vague or ambiguous answers
- **CRITICAL**: Add follow-up questions for ANY unclear responses - do not proceed with ambiguity
- Look for responses like "depends", "maybe", "not sure", "mix of", "somewhere between"
- Create clarification questions file if ANY ambiguities are detected
- **Do not proceed until ALL ambiguities are resolved**

### Step 6: Generate Infrastructure Design Artifacts
- Create `aidlc-docs/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/infrastructure-design.md`
- Create `aidlc-docs/construction/{unit-name}/infrastructure-design/deployment-architecture.md`
- If shared infrastructure: Create `aidlc-docs/construction/shared-infrastructure.md`

### Step 7: Present Completion Message
- Present completion message in this structure:
     1. **Completion Announcement** (mandatory): Always start with this:

```markdown
# 🏢 Infrastructure Design Complete - [unit-name]
```

     2. **AI Summary** (optional): Provide structured bullet-point summary of infrastructure design
        - Format: "Infrastructure design has mapped [description]:"
        - List key infrastructure services and components (bullet points)
        - List deployment architecture decisions and rationale
        - Mention cloud provider choices and service mappings
        - DO NOT include workflow instructions ("please review", "let me know", "proceed to next phase", "before we proceed")
        - Keep factual and content-focused
     3. **Formatted Workflow Message** (mandatory): Always end with this exact format:

```markdown
> **📋 <u>**REVIEW REQUIRED:**</u>**  
> Please examine the infrastructure design at: `aidlc-docs/construction/[unit-name]/infrastructure-design/`



> **🚀 <u>**WHAT'S NEXT?**</u>**
>
> **You may:**
>
> 🔧 **Request Changes** - Ask for modifications to the infrastructure design based on your review  
> ✅ **Continue to Next Stage** - Approve infrastructure design and proceed to **Code Generation**

---
```

### Step 8: Wait for Explicit Approval
- Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves the infrastructure design
- Approval must be clear and unambiguous
- If user requests changes, update the design and repeat the approval process

### Step 9: Record Approval and Update Progress
- Log approval in audit.md with timestamp
- Record the user's approval response with timestamp
- Mark Infrastructure Design stage complete in aidlc-state.md
